# ECE241---Digital-Systems
Lab Projects completed in Verilog Hardware Description Language(HDL) at the University of Toronto in Fall 2021.

### Lab Overview:
**Lab 2** - **2-to-1 Multiplexer & Seven Segment Display**\
Part 1: Building a 2-to-1 Multiplexer using 7400-series chips (AND, OR, NOT Gate)\
Part 2: Design a Hex Decoder for a Seven Segment Display

**Lab 3** - **Adders & Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**\
Part 1: Using Always block & case statements to build a 7-to-1 Multiplexer\
Part 2: Using hierarchy(Half Adder, Full Adder) to build a 4-Bit Ripple-Carry Adder Circuit\
Part 3: Using Part 1, Part 2, and the Hex Decoder to build an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

**Lab 4** - **Latches, Flip Flops, and Registers**\
Part 2: Building a Simple ALU with register circuit for Part II. Register is built from positive edge-triggeref flip flops with active-low synchronous reset\
Part 3: Building a left/right 8-bit rotating register with parallel load circuit

**Lab 5** - **Clocks and Counters**\
Part 1: Implementing an 8-Bit Counter\
Part 2: Designed and implemented a circuit using counters that repeatedly outputs the hexadecimal values 0 through F\
Part 3: Implemented a Morse code encoder using a Lookup Table(LUT) to store the codes, a Shift Register, and a Rate Divider

**Lab 6** - **Finite State Machine**\
Part 1: Implemented a basic finite state machine (FSM) in Verilog\
Part 2: Modifying a Verilog Code with Finite State Machine

**Lab 7** - M**emory & VGA Display**\
Part 1: Created a small RAM block using Quartus IP Catalog to create memory module and testing using ModelSim
Part 2: Designed a circuit that draw/displays a filled squared at any location on the VGA screen with any color.
